### Project Introduction:
This project investigates the impact of mobile phone usage on students' health and academic performance. The dataset comprises various attributes related to students' demographics, mobile phone usage patterns, health symptoms, and academic outcomes. By analyzing these data points, we aim to understand how mobile phone usage affects students' academic success and well-being. The goal of this project is both descriptive and predictive: to describe current trends and predict potential outcomes based on mobile phone usage. We plan to use supervised learning techniques, specifically classification and regression analysis, to identify significant predictors of academic performance and health outcomes. This involves exploring relationships between mobile phone usage patterns (e.g., time spent, activities, and educational app usage) and variables such as performance impact, distraction, attention span, and health symptoms.

### Research Question:
How does mobile phone usage influence students' academic performance and health, and what are the key predictors of these outcomes?
