### Project Introduction:
This project investigates the impact of mobile phone usage on students' health and academic performance. The dataset comprises various attributes related to students' demographics, mobile phone usage patterns, health symptoms, and academic outcomes. By analyzing these data points, we aim to understand how mobile phone usage affects students' academic success and well-being. The goal of this project is both descriptive and predictive: to describe current trends and predict potential outcomes based on mobile phone usage. We plan to use supervised learning techniques, specifically classification and regression analysis, to identify significant predictors of academic performance and health outcomes. This involves exploring relationships between mobile phone usage patterns (e.g., time spent, activities, and educational app usage) and variables such as performance impact, distraction, attention span, and health symptoms.

### Research Question:
How does mobile phone usage influence students' academic performance and health, and what are the key predictors of these outcomes?

- [The Relationship between Cellphone Usage on the Physical and Mental Wellbeing of University Students: A Cross-Sectional Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9368281/pdf/ijerph-19-09352.pdf)

### Data Source and Description:
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/innocentmfa/students-health-and-academic-performance?resource=download) is sourced from a survey conducted on students' mobile phone usage, health, and academic performance.
The attributes include:

- Names: Student names
- Age: Student ages (in years)
- Gender: Male/Female
- Mobile phone: Do students own a mobile phone? (Yes/No)
- Mobile Operating System: Type of mobile operating system used (e.g., Android, iOS, Other)
- Mobile phone use for education: Frequency of mobile phone usage for educational purposes (Sometime/Frequently/Rarely)
- Mobile phone activities: List of mobile phone activities used for educational purposes (e.g., online research, educational apps, email, online learning platforms)
- Helpful for studying: Do students find mobile phone use helpful for studying? (Yes/No)
- Educational Apps: List of educational apps used
- Daily usages: Average daily time spent using mobile phone for educational purposes (in hours)
- Performance impact: How does mobile phone use impact academic performance? (Agree/Neutral/Strongly agree)
- Usage distraction: Does mobile phone use distract from studying? (During Exams/Not Distracting/During Class Lectures/While Studying)
- Attention span: Has mobile phone use affected attention span? (Yes/No)
- Useful features: What features of mobile phones are useful for learning? (e.g., Internet Access, Camera, Calculator, Notes Taking App)
- Health Risks: Are students aware of potential health risks associated with excessive mobile phone use? (Yes/No/Only Partially)
- Beneficial subject: Which subjects benefit most from mobile phone use? (e.g., Accounting, Browsing Material, Research)
- Usage symptoms: Are students experiencing any physical or mental symptoms related to mobile phone use? (e.g., Sleep disturbance, headaches, Anxiety or Stress, All of these)
- Symptom frequency: How often are symptoms experienced? (Sometimes/Never/Rarely/Frequently)
- Health precautions: Are students taking precautions to mitigate potential health risks? (Taking Break during prolonged use/Using Blue light filter/Limiting Screen Time/None of Above)
- Health rating: How would students rate their overall physical and mental health? (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor)

### Data Understanding and EDA:
We created several different visualizations to gain an understanding on the dataset we are working with.

This first visualization looks at the age distribution of the students in the dataset. We see that the majority of the students fall into the range of 21-25 with just under 70 of the 100 students falling into that category.

Next, we wanted to see how the gender distribution looked and found that most of the students were males.

One of the attributes in the data is 'Usage symptoms' which has the following symptom categories: 'Headache', 'All of these', 'Sleep disturbance', 'Anxiety or Stress', 'Sleep disturbance;Anxiety or Stress', and 'Headache;Sleep disturbance;Anxiety or Stress;All of these'. We see that most students spend about 4-6 hours on their phones daily and experience all of the symptoms. Sleep disturbance and headache were common and high-frequency symptoms across the higher daily usage ranges.

Another area we explored was the type of mobile activities that each age category ranged in. Keeping in mind that the majority of the students fall into the 21-25 age category, we see that this age group engages in all the following activities 'Messaging', 'Social Media', and 'Web-browsing'.

The graph provides a clear picture of the mobile operating system landscape among your respondents, highlighting the relative prevalence of each platform. The students in this dataset mainly have Androids.

This analysis helps in understanding user perceptions and can be used to address potential issues related to mobile phone usage and performance in educational or work settings. The majority of students believe that mobile phone use has an impact on performance or feel neutral.

The pie chart displays the proportion of different symptom frequencies reported by respondents.

Here we compare the types of distractions experienced by males and females, providing a clear picture of how mobile phone usage impacts attention.

We can see if students are aware of potential health risks associated with excessive mobile phone use through this visualization.

### Data Preparation:
The data preparation process in the notebook begins with importing essential libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization. The dataset is then loaded from a CSV file hosted on GitHub into a pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv function. Basic information about the dataset, including the number of non-null entries, data types of the columns, and memory usage, is displayed using the df.info() command. The data was checked for null values and the small number of null values were dropped. When trying to use a certain column to create a visualization, there was an error due to the column name having extra space so the data frame columns were cleaned with the .strip function. These initial steps ensure that the data is ready for further analysis and manipulation.
